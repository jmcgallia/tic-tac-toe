# TIC TAC TOE GAME
- This is a Tic Tac Toe game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It is a project for a web development course called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
- Ideas and guidance are given in the course, but all code it my own. I made this project to learn.
- [Here](https://jordan-mcgalliard.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) is the live version of the project. 

## To be implemented
- Everything
- An algorithm to make the AI better (it is currently random.)
